# Use Standard Promoted Action Group Names And Placements

## Description
Business Central ships a fixed vocabulary of promoted action groups, and users build muscle memory around where each kind of action lives. When you define `area(Promoted)` groups, reusing the standard caption and placement for a given action class makes the page feel native; inventing your own caption or putting an action in the wrong group forces every user to relearn your page. Frontier models tend to emit plausible-but-nonstandard captions (`Go To`, `Vendor Actions`, `Related`) instead of the established BC names, which is exactly what breaks cross-page consistency.

## Best Practice
Map each action to its conventional group and use the exact standard caption: `Home`/`Process` for data-modifying and workflow actions (entity/card/document pages use `Home`, lists and worksheets use `Process`); an entity-named group (`Customer`, `Item`, `Order`) for navigation tied to the current record (statistics, ledger entries, dimensions); `Navigate` for related pages that are useful regardless of the selected record; `Report` for printing and analysis; and the workflow groups `Posting`, `Release`, `Approve`, `Request Approval`, and `Prepare` for their respective document lifecycle actions. Only `Posting` (Post / Post and Print / Preview) and `Release` (Release / Reopen) should render as split buttons via `ShowAs = SplitButton`; everything else is a normal dropdown. Within a common group keep the same action sequence you see on the matching base-app page (e.g. mirror Sales Order for a sales document) so order stays predictable.

## Anti Pattern
Custom captions for what is really a standard group (`Vendor Actions` instead of the `Vendor` entity group, `Go To` instead of `Navigate`), posting or statistics actions dropped into the wrong group, or many tiny one-action groups that fragment the ribbon. The reviewer signal is an `area(Promoted)` block whose `group` captions do not match the base-application names for the same page type, or a `ShowAs = SplitButton` on anything other than `Posting`/`Release`.
